			<h1>2022 Awards Eligibility</h1>
			<p>Hello! I'm Filip Hajdar Drnovšek Zorko. I had four short stories published in 2021 - three fantasy and one science fiction - and I'd love it if you wanted to consider them in your awards reading. I'm also in my second year of eligibility for the Astounding Award.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><span class="story-title"><a href="http://www.beneath-ceaseless-skies.com/stories/when-your-being-here-is-gentler-than-your-absence-hard/">"When Your Being Here Is Gentler Than Your Absence Hard"</a></span>, a gay fantasy romance about a woman who travels back in time to protect her lover from an enemy in their present. I'd recommend it equally for fans of women giving speeches and fans of women with swords. Featured in <a href="https://maria-is-reading.blogspot.com/2021/03/my-sci-fi-fantasy-horror-short-fiction.html">Maria Haskins' short fiction roundup.</a></li>
				<li>Based on a Slovenian folktale, <span class="story-title"><a href="https://podcastle.org/2021/06/15/podcastle-683-three-for-hers/">"Three For Hers"</a></span> is about a woman who enters the service of the local tyrant, the Margrave, to bring him down from the inside, only to find herself forbidden from expressing anger. It’s a story of resistance, revenge, and above all rage, and it was a <a href="https://www.tor.com/2021/07/21/must-read-speculative-short-fiction-june-2021/">Tor.com must-read for the month of June</a>.</li>
				<li><span class="story-title"><a href="https://www.beneath-ceaseless-skies.com/stories/the-last-days-of-summer-in-the-city-of-olives/">"The Last Days of Summer in the City of Olives"</a></span> is about what happens when the bookish princess who wants to be left alone in a library gets her wish. It’s a story about personal responsibility, pacifism, and smartarse professors, set in a fictionalised version of Bologna. Also, olives!</li>
				<li><span class="story-title"><a href="https://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/fiction/red-is-our-country/">"Red Is Our Country"</a></span> is a Mars story about how one person's frontier is almost always another person's home. It's about the difficulty of making connections and the drive to make them nonetheless, even when that may not be the wisest course of action. Also, despite this being the only science fiction story on the list, there's a dragon.</li>
