			<h1>2021 Awards Eligibility</h1>
			<p>Hello! I'm Filip Hajdar Drnovšek Zorko. I had two short stories published in 2020 and I'd love it if you wanted to consider either of them in your awards reading. As these were my first two publications period, I'm also in my first year of eligibility for the Astounding Award!</p>
			<ul>
				<li><span class="story-title"><a href="http://clarkesworldmagazine.com/drnovsek-zorko_01_20/">"The AI That Looked at the Sun"</a></span> (4695 words), a story about a newly-sapient AI who (in descending order of importance) falls in love with the sun and accidentally starts a revolution.</li>
				<li><span class="story-title"><a href="https://escapepod.org/2020/09/17/escape-pod-750-the-anatomy-of-miracles/">"The Anatomy of Miracles"</a></span> (5969 words), in which a weary old alien pondering the death of his people and a bored teenage girl whose main worry is what her parents think of her dating life discover that sometimes, the scale of your problems doesn't make how you feel about them any different.</li>
			</ul>
